 <p>I don't sincerely believe that <em>the noodle you bought from Walmart for 0.99$</em> will look like this after you cook even if you're <strong>Gordon Ramsey</strong> but anyway </p>
  <h3>Ingredients </h3>
   <li>Ready to cook Noodle </li>
   <li>Seasoning that comes within the packet </li>
   <li>Boiling Water </li>
<h3>Steps </h3>
<ol> 
<li>Gently take out the ready-to-cook Noodle out of its package and place it in a deep bowl</li>

<li>Put the bamboo sauce on the noodle block</li>
<li> Pour some boiling water into your bowl and wait for at least 5 minutes</li>
<li> Your Noodle is ready to eat but be mindful about the MSG intake</li>
